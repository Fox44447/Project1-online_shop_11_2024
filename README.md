# Project1-online_shop_11_2024
This is for tests. Super basic project that came to my mind at the gym's treadmil. It's to progress my JS skills


------------

The assumptions of my task are as follows:

-I’m coding in JavaScript

- The code should be able to  spit out with the alert() command a text informing the client of the online shop how much has he received a discount given certain parameters:


- Client receives a 15% discount on the next purchase after:
- Former placing order at the online store at least 10x times for the amount of >= 80 each time



- The code should spit out the text in the alert window of the browser informing ‚Congratulations! You have been granted 15% discount on your next shop due to your loyalty and meeting the discount requirements 🙂🎁’

- If the 15% discount is not available yet for the client the lines of code should return to the alert window an information with calculated x times of purchases needed until the criteria are met. For example: „5 orders more for at least 80 and you will be in for our glamorous discount”
